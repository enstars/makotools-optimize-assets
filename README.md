# assets-optimize

Scripts for optimizing assets. Referenced from https://css-tricks.com/converting-and-optimizing-images-from-the-command-line/.

See usage in !optimize.sh. Running !optimize.sh has not been tested,
so copy-pasting commands one by one might be safer.

You're recommended to make a new directory `assets` in the home dir
for ease of running commands. `assets` is alread added to gitignore
for you.
